    <h1>Dialga</h1>
    <p>Dialga is a dark blue sauropod-like Pok√©mon with some gray metallic portions, 
        such as its chestplate, which has a diamond in the center. It also has various 
        light blue stripes. It has a fin-like structure on its back and a crest on its head, 
        resembling a dinosaur. Dialga also has two horns on top of its head, two fang-like 
        horns around its mouth, and three spines on the back of its neck. It has three claws 
        on each foot of the same metallic looks as its chestplate. Faint cracks exist across 
        its body. The wing-like structure on its back can be used to focus the flow of time, 
        as seen in Explorers of Time, Darkness, and Sky.</p>
